# Colors
The color palette is based on the Tailwind's nomenclature. Each color has 10 variations from light to dark density.
Each color variation can be associated to text, background or border definition to create a new utility class.

For example from `primary-600` color variation, the following css classes are built:
- `bg-primary-600` for red backgrounds
- `text-primary-600` for red texts
- `border-primary-600`  for red borders

In practice, few of these colors are used in the templates, but having the whole range of variations give extra flexibility for future designs.
